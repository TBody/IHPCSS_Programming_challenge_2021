## What is the challenge? ##

This challenge introduces a simple problem: take a metal plate, put a flame below it and simulate the temperature propagation across that metal plate. For simplicity, we assume that the area touched by the flame will always be at the same temperature (arbitrarily put at 50 degrees; yes it is a tiny flame). The rest of the metal plate however will start heating up as the heat propagates outwards the lighter zone. 

The challenge is that you have 30 seconds to process as many iterations as possible. Of course, this is equivalent to asking you to decrease the runtime; the faster your iterations, the more you can execute under 30 seconds.

## What is this repository for? ##

* You will find here everything you need to compete; source codes, makefiles, documentation, scripts, tests...
* You can for both tracks:
  * Classic parallel programming: MPI + OpenMP
  * Accelerator: MPI + OpenACC
* Each of these is available in C and FORTRAN 90
* It provides you with a pre-setup experimental protocol; it makes sure contestants compete in the same conditions and allows to compare experiments fairly.

## How do I get set up? ##
### Download ###
All you have to do is clone this repository: ```git clone https://github.com/capellil/IHPCSS_Programming_challenge_2021.git```.

Note that you are strongly encouraged to work on the source files provided instead of making copies. To keep it short, you will discover in the sections below that multiple scripts have been written to make your life easier (makefile, submitting to compute nodes etc..). However, these scripts are designed to work with the files provided, not the arbitrary copies you could make.

### Compile ###
Due to some surprises from the nvhpc module, there are now two scripts available; one that will happily compile all CPU codes, and one for GPU codes.
- ```./compile_cpu_versions``` for the CPU ones
- ```./compile_gpu_versions``` for the GPU ones
 
If the right module is not loaded, it will complain and will give you the command to issue before trying again.

What happens behind the scene?

As you will quickly see, there is one folder for C source codes, one for FORTRAN source codes. Inside, each version has a specific file:

| Model | C version | FORTRAN version |
|-------|-----------|-----------------|
| MPI + OpenMP | cpu.c | cpu.F90 |
| MPI + OpenACC | gpu.c | gpu.F90 |

And of course, modify the file corresponding to the combination you want to work on. No need to make a copy, work on the original file, everything is version controlled remember.

### Submit ###
(***Note**: Jobs submitted with this script will use the corresponding reservation queue for big jobs.*)

A script has been written for you to easily submit your work to Bridges via SLURM: ```./submit.sh LANGUAGE IMPLEMENTATION SIZE OUTPUT_FILE```. The parameters are always the same:
* LANGUAGE = ```c``` | ```f```
* IMPLEMENTATION = ```cpu``` | ```gpu```
* SIZE = ```small``` | ```big```

How does it work? As you have probably seen, there is a ```slurm_scripts``` folder. It contains two SLURM submission scripts for each version (OpenMP + MPI, OpenACC + MPI etc...): one for the small grid, one for the big grid. That allows each SLURM script to be tailored (number of nodes, type of nodes, walltime...) for the implementation and size demanded.

Examples:
* to submit the C version of the CPU code on the small dataset: ```./submit.sh c cpu small myOutput.txt```
* to submit the FORTRAN version of the GPU code on the big dataset: ```./submit.sh f gpu big myOutput.txt```

### Verify ###
The correctness of your code will be evaluated using the temperature change observed throughout iterations. Once you have a file containing the output of your program, you can check the correctness by using the ```verify.sh``` as follows: ```./verify.sh LANGUAGE IMPLEMENTATION SIZE FILE_TO_VERIFY```. The parameters are always the same:
* LANGUAGE = ```c``` | ```f```
* IMPLEMENTATION = ```cpu``` | ```gpu```
* SIZE = ```small``` | ```big```

This will automatically fetch the corresponding reference file in the ```reference``` folder and compare all temperature changes with yours. If your executable has run more iterations than the original executable, only the iterations in common are compared.

Examples:
* to verify the C version of the CPU code on the small dataset: ```./verify.sh c cpu small myOutput.txt```
* to verify the FORTRAN version of the GPU code on the big dataset: ```./verify.sh f gpu big myOutput.txt```

## What kind of optimisations are not allowed? ##

* Changing the compilation process (that is: using different compilers, compiler flags, external libraries etc...). The point in this challenge is not for you to read hundreds of pages of documentation to find an extra flag people may have missed.
* Changing the running process; provided scripts already use a sensible configuration. Again, you only have a few days; the objective of the hybrid challenge is for you to play with the code, not spend hours defining the best MPI / OpenMP ratio for instance.
* Changing the submission process; such as using more nodes for instance.
* Changing the algorithm; yes it is a naive one but it exposes good characteristics for you to practice what you have learned in OpenMP, MPI and OpenACC.
* Reducing the amount of work to be done such as ignoring the cells whose value will be zero during the entire simulation.
* Removing the printing phase from the iteration loop or changing the frequency at which it prints.
* Bypassing the buffer copy using a pointer swap.
* Decreasing the accuracy of the calculations by switching from doubles to floats.
* You are not sure about whether a certain optimisation is allowed or not? Just ask :)

## Send your solution to the competition ##
Participating to the hybrid challenge is for fun; to practice what you have learned during the IHPCSS. But if you want to see how far you got, you can send your solution for it to be assessed and evaluated as part of the competition, and know if you managed to develop the fastest code of your category (CPU or GPU).

If you want your solution to be assessed, send an email **by Wednesday 28th of July 2021 11:59PM AOE** to CAPELLI Ludovic (email address in the slack channel) containing:
* The full name of each team member (typically no more than 3 members per team so that small teams means everybody participates), because if your team wins we need to know whom congratulate :)
* The source file of the version you optimised. Typically, it will mean:
  * ```cpu.c``` (or ```cpu.F90```) if you focused on CPU using the MPI + OpenMP version.
  * ```gpu.c``` (or ```gpu.F90```) if you focused on GPU using the MPI + OpenACC version.

**Note**: there is no need to send the ```makefile``` / ```submit.sh``` scripts or else, send just the source file of the version you optimised. Your code will be compiled and run using the original ```makefile``` / ```submit.sh``` scripts provided, on the ```big``` grid. This way, every participant has their code compiled & run in strictly identical conditions.

## Whom do I talk to? ##

Me or any of the IHPCSS staff. You can find me and my email address in the slack channel called "Programming challenge". (Click on the link posted in the general slack channel about the programming challenge, it will take you to the programming challenge channel so you can join.)
