## What is the challenge? ##

This challenge introduces a simple problem: take a metal plate, put a flame below it and simulate the temperature propagation across that metal plate. For simplicity, we assume that the area touched by the flame will always be at the same temperature (arbitrarily put at 50 degrees; yes it is a tiny flame). The rest of the metal plate however will start heating up as the heat propagates outwards the lighter zone. 

The challenge is that you have 30 seconds to process as many iterations as possible. Of course, this is equivalent to asking you to decrease the runtime; the faster your iterations, the more you can execute under 30 seconds.

## What is this repository for? ##

* You will find here everything you need to compete; source codes, makefiles, documentation, scripts, tests...
* You can for both tracks:
  * Classic parallel programming: MPI + OpenMP
  * Accelerator: MPI + OpenACC
* Each of these is available
* It provides you with a pre-setup experimental protocol; it makes sure contestants compete in the same conditions and allows to compare experiments fairly.

## How do I get set up? ##
### Download the source codes ###
All you have to do is clone this repository: ```git clone https://github.com/capellil/IHPCSS_Programming_challenge_2021.git```.

Note that you are strongly encouraged to work on the source files provided instead of making copies. To keep it short, you will discover in the sections below that multiple scripts have been written to make your life easier (makefile, submitting to compute nodes etc..). However, these scripts are designed to work with the files provided, not the arbitrary copies you could make.

### Compile the source codes ###
There is a makefile as you can see; it will compile all versions and generate the corresponding binaries in a folder ```bin```. To be compatible with OpenACC, we will use the moduel nvhpc, which can compile OpenACC and non-OpenACC versions so it will keep everything consistent. Make sure you load the right module with ```module load nvhpc``` before making, you can put it in your ".bashrc" for instance.

What happens behind the scene?

As you will quickly see, there is one folder for C source codes, one for FORTRAN source codes. Inside, each version has a specific file:

| Model | C version | FORTRAN version |
|-------|-----------|-----------------|
| MPI + OpenMP | cpu.c | cpu.F90 |
| MPI + OpenACC | gpu.c | gpu.F90 |

And of course, modify the file corresponding to the combination you want to work on. No need to make a copy, work on the original file, everything is version controlled remember.

### Submit to Bridges compute nodes ###
(***Note**: Jobs submitted with this script use the reservation queue ```challenge```, which becomes active on Thursday the 22th of July 2021 at 8:00pm local. No need to submit your jobs before that time then because they will be queued but will not be executed until the reservation queue becomes active.*)

A script has been written for you to easily submit your work to Bridges via SLURM: ```./submit.sh LANGUAGE IMPLEMENTATION SIZE OUTPUT_FILE```. The parameters LANGUAGE, IMPLEMENTATION and SIZE. The output file this time is no longer optional however, because you need a file to which redirect the output of your job.

How does it work? As you have probably seen, there is a ```slurm_scripts``` folder. It contains two SLURM submission scripts for each version (OpenMP + MPI, OpenACC + MPI etc...): one for the small grid, one for the big grid. That allows each SLURM script to be tailored (number of nodes, type of nodes, walltime...) for the implementation and size demanded.

### Verification ###
The correctness of code will be evaluated based on the temperature change observed at a certain iteration:
- For the small C CPU version, iteration 10,000 should yield: 0.001330995453471928
- For the small F CPU version, iteration 10,000 should yield: 0.001330995453464823

## What kind of optimisations are not allowed? ##

* Changing the compilation process (that is: using different compilers, compiler flags, external libraries etc...). The point in this challenge is not for you to read hundreds of pages of documentation to find an extra flag people may have missed.
* Changing the running process; provided scripts already use a sensible configuration. Again, you only have a few days; the objective of the hybrid challenge is for you to play with the code, not spend hours defining the best MPI / OpenMP ratio for instance.
* Changing the submission process; such as using more nodes for instance.
* Changing the algorithm; yes it is a naive one but it exposes good characteristics for you to practice what you have learned in OpenMP, MPI and OpenACC.
* Reducing the amount of work to be done such as ignoring the cells whose value will be zero during the entire simulation.
* Removing the track_progress from the loop or changing the frequency at which it prints.
* Bypassing the buffer copy using a pointer swap.
* Decreasing the accuracy of the calculations by switching from doubles to floats.
* You are not sure about whether a certain optimisation is allowed or not? Just ask :)

## Send your solution to the competition ##
Participating to the hybrid challenge is for fun; to practice what you have learned during the IHPCSS. But if you want to see how far you got, you can send your solution for it to be assessed and evaluated as part of the competition, and know if you managed to develop the fastest code of your category (CPU or GPU).

If you want your solution to be assessed, send an email **by Wednesday 28th of July 2021 11:59PM AOE** to CAPELLI Ludovic (email address in the lack channel) containing:
* The full name of each team member (no more than 3 members per team remember), because if your team wins we need to know who we should call on stage :)
* The source file of the version you optimised. Typically, it will certainly mean:
  * ```cpu.c``` (or ```cpu.F90```) if you focused on CPU using the MPI + OpenMP version.
  * ```gpu.c``` (or ```gpu.F90```) if you focused on GPU using the MPI + OpenACC version.

**Note**: there is no need to send the ```makefile``` / ```submit.sh``` scripts or else, send just the source file of the version you optimised. Your code will be compiled and run using the original ```makefile``` / ```submit.sh``` scripts provided, on the ```big``` grid. This way, every participant has their code compiled & run in strictly identical conditions.
